# text-work
The goal is to create a bunch of tools to analyze and process text files.

Spellcheck: A program heavily influenced by cs50's "speller" project. I have
used quite a few of the ideas from it, with a lot of my own ideas mixed in. The
current build writes the output to a file called misspelled.txt.

//TODO: Prevent names of people from registering as misspelled.
